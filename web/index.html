		<p>A Wiki software  &nbsp (also known as a wiki engine or a wiki application) is collaborative software that runs a wiki, which allows users to create and collaboratively edit pages or entries via a web browser. A wiki system is usually a web application that runs on one or more web servers. </p>
		

		<p>The content, including previous revisions, is usually stored in either a file system or a database. Wikis are a type of web content management system, and the most commonly supported off-the-shelf software that web hosting facilities offer.</p>

				<h4>Commenting</h4>
				<p>
					Article Comments is an extension enabled by default on Fandom. The comments section can be found at the bottom of article pages on most communities. It can be accessed in one click by clicking the "Comments" button. If comments are not available for a content page, you can use its talk page instead, which is located in the "Edit" dropdown. This extension can be disabled by the community's administrators via Admin Dashboard's Wiki features.

				<h4>Invest In Productive Tools</h4>
				<p>Office productivity tools are applications that allow for the viewing, creating and modifying of general office documents (e.g. spreadsheets, memos, presentations, letters, personal database, form generation, image editing, etc.). Office productivity tools also include applications for managing employee tasks.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Always Be Curious</h4>
				<p>Curiosity, or the strong desire to learn or know something, originates from the Latin word ‘curiosus’ – eager to know, inquisitive.</p>

				<h4>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h4>
				<p>By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Version Control</h4>
				<p>As a developer, version control is something that you must know about. Version control systems let you keep track of changes made to the code over time. And not just this, they also make it easy to revert back to an earlier version if you screw something up. Thus using verion control will save you some sleepless nights for sure. One of the most widely used version control systems is Git. Thus knowing git has been a requirement for almost every development job these days.</p>

	<p>While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must always remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to create your signature style.</p>
